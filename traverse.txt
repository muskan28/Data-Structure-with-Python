A linked list, or one way list, is a linear collection of data elements,
called nodes,where the linear order is given by means of pointers.
That is each node is divided into two parts: The first part contains the information of the element
and the second part,called the link field or nextpointer field contains tge address of the next node in the list.

ALGORITHM FOR TRAVERSING A LINKED LIST

Let LIST be a linked list in memory stored in linear arrays INFO and LINK with 
START pointing to the first element and NULL indicating the end of the LIST.
The traversing algorithm uses a pointer variable PTR which points to the node that is currently being processed.

1. Set PTR:=START [Initializes prointer PTR]
2. Repeat steps 3 and 4 while PTR!= NULL
3.		 Apply PROCESS to INFO[PTR]
4.		 Set PTR:=LINK[PTR]    (PTR now points to the next node)
	(End of step 2 loop)
5. Exit
