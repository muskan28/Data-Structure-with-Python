Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Algorithm For Tower of Hanoi Problem

TOWER(N,BEG,AUX,END)
	
	1.IF N=1,THEN:
		a. WRITE: BEG->END
		b. RETURN
	2.[MOVE N-1 DISKS FROM PEG BEG TO PEG AUX]
	   CALL TOWER(N-1,BEG,END,AUX)
	3.WRITE:BEG->END
	4.[MOVE N-1 DISKS FROM PEG AUX TO PEG END]
	   CALL TOWER(N-1,AUX,BEG,END)
	5.RETURN
